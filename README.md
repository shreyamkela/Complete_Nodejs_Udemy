<b>The Complete Node.js Developer Course (2nd Edition)</b> - course on Udemy

- Link - https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2/

- This repository covers sections 1 - 6 from the course. For further sections refer node-todo repository

- Note: - For app.js/server.js/etc respective to each section, refer Info.txt of that section. Multiple versions of app.js/etc were maintained (for each section), with code and comments relating to those particular lectures. Each app.js/etc was given file name related to the last lecture that covered the code in that file. If there still is an app.js/etc in any section, then quite possibly it the most recent app.js/etc for that section.
